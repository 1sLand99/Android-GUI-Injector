This app is for educational purposes only. I am not responsible for any damage caused by this app. <br />
Please note that the Zygote Injection feature is experimental and may not work on all devices. <br />
I am not responsible for any damage caused by the zygote injection feature. If you are unsure,
please do not use it as I am not 100% sure if setting usap pool usage to false is safe on all devices. <br />
